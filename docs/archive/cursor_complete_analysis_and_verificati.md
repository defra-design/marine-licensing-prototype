**User**

I'm writing a prompt for Cursor to do some development work and need some help. The Analysis phase needs completing as does the Verification phase. And the other sections need reviewing and improving.

Don't assume anything - Ask questions for clarity

here's what I've got so far:


# Context
In the ‘multiple-site-v2’ version of the prototype for the manual-entry journey where there is more than one site (/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/manual-entry/does-your-project-involve-more-than-one-site), we have so far added the ability to add a site which appears on the/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/manual-entry/review-site-details page and then by selecting Add the next site button loop around adding more sites that appear on the review page and the Site numbering works perfectly.

When Save and continue is elected the Your sites page /versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/manual-entry/site-details-added is loaded where the sites will appear.

The routing for manual entry is here: app/routes/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption-manual-entry.js

Currently only the sites that have been added via the file upload journey appear on this page so we need to add in the manual entry sites too and in the right order - so after the file upload sites if any have been loaded or just the manual entry sites if no file uploaded sites have been added etc.

The file upload journey starts here /multiple-sites-v2/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates when Upload a file with the coordinates of the site and continues through the main /multiple-sites-v2/exemption/ up until the review page which is here: app/views/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/review-site-details.html. The routing for that is app/routes/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption.js. This works perfectly (but just for one file upload at the moment)

Sites also appear on the app/views/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/check-answers-multiple-sites.html page which could also contain file upload and manual entry sites.

Currently on the file upload journey sites can be deleted so there is a site counter thing that works out what number each site should be.

The `Add another site` button on the `/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/site-details-added` page needs to take users to the `/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates` page

# Analysis phase

# Implementation phase
Sites from the manual sites journey need to be viewable on the Your sites page

Sites from the file upload journey need to be viewable on the Your sites page

When multiple sites are added they are named site 1, site 2, site 3 etc so if 4 sites have been added on the file upload journey then any sites added on the manual entry journey would then be site 5, site 6 etc.

All sites should be viewable on the check answers page in the check answers  format which is slightly different to the review site details page

# Verification phase

**Cursor**

I can help you complete and improve this prompt for Cursor. To provide the best assistance, I need to clarify several aspects of the current implementation and desired behavior:

## Questions for Clarity

### Current State & Data Structure
1. **How are sites currently stored in the session data?** 
   - Are manual entry sites stored differently from file upload sites?
   - What are the exact session variable names used for each type?

2. **What's the current behavior when both journeys are used?**
   - If a user uploads a file with 3 sites, then adds 2 manual sites, what currently happens?
   - Do the manual sites overwrite file upload sites, or are they stored separately?

3. **Site numbering logic:**
   - Is there currently a centralized way to determine the next available site number?
   - How does the deletion functionality work for file upload sites, and should manual sites be deletable too?

### Desired Behavior
4. **Site ordering priority:**
   - You mentioned "after the file upload sites if any have been loaded" - should this always be the case, or should it be based on the order they were added chronologically?

5. **Check answers format:**
   - What specifically is different about the "check answers format" vs the review page format?
   - Are there different data fields or presentation styles?

### Integration Points
6. **Navigation flow:**
   - When users click "Add another site" from site-details-added, should they be able to choose between file upload or manual entry again?
   - Should there be any restrictions on mixing the two approaches?

7. **Data persistence:**
   - Should users be able to edit/delete sites from either journey once they're on the "Your sites" page?
   - What happens if someone wants to add more sites after reaching check-answers?

### Technical Constraints
8. **Route handling:**
   - Are there any specific routing patterns or conventions I should be aware of?
   - Should the manual entry sites use the same deletion/editing mechanisms as file upload sites?

Once I have these details, I can help complete the Analysis and Verification phases and improve the overall prompt structure.

**User**

Ask me questions one at a time.

1. How are sites currently stored in the session data?

Can you analyse the files specified in the prompt to find out?

---

**Cursor**

I'll analyze the files you mentioned to understand how sites are currently stored in session data. Let me examine the routing files and templates to see the data structure.

Let me continue reading this file to see how the site data is stored:

Now let me check the file upload routing to understand how those sites are stored:

Let me search for where sites are stored in arrays to understand the data structure better:

Now let me examine the "Your sites" page to see how it currently displays file upload sites:

Now let me check if there's a manual entry version of the site-details-added page:

Based on my analysis of the files, I can now answer your first question about how sites are currently stored in session data:

## Answer: How sites are currently stored in session data

**File Upload Sites:**
- Stored in `req.session.data['sites']` as an array of objects
- Each site object has properties like:
  - `name` - the site name
  - `startDate` - object with `day`, `month`, `year` 
  - `endDate` - object with `day`, `month`, `year`
  - `description` - activity description

**Manual Entry Sites:**
- Stored as individual session variables with a naming pattern:
- **Site 1:** Uses base names like:
  - `manual-site-name-text-input`
  - `manual-start-date-date-input-day/month/year`
  - `manual-activity-details-text-area`
  - `manual-latitude`, `manual-longitude`
- **Site 2+:** Uses numbered patterns like:
  - `manual-site-2-name-text-input`
  - `manual-site-2-start-date-date-input-day/month/year`
  - `manual-site-2-activity-details-text-area` 
  - `manual-site-2-latitude`, `manual-site-2-longitude`

**Key Differences:**
1. File upload sites use a **structured array** approach
2. Manual entry sites use **individual session variables** with a naming convention
3. There's a `manual-current-site` variable tracking the highest site number added
4. Manual sites share some global settings like `manual-same-activity-dates` and `manual-same-activity-description`

**Current Issue:**
The "Your sites" page (`site-details-added.html`) only reads from the `data['sites']` array, so manual entry sites don't appear there yet.

Should I proceed to the next question about current behavior when both journeys are used?

---

**User**

Yes, remember we need to collate everything we find into a single prompt at the end. Next question please

---

**Cursor**

## Question 2: What's the current behavior when both journeys are used?

Let me examine the routing and session handling to understand what happens when a user goes through both the file upload and manual entry journeys.

Now I need to check where the manual entry flow ends and where it should redirect to:

Now let me check where the file upload flow's "Save and continue" goes:

Let me check the manual entry review page more carefully to see where "Save and continue" should go:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. Looking at line 717, the manual entry review page's form submits to `../site-details-added`, but the routing file shows it redirects to `../task-list` instead. Let me confirm by checking if there's a route handler for this:

Based on my analysis, I can now answer your second question:

## Answer: Current behavior when both journeys are used

**Current State:**
1. **File upload sites** → Complete the flow → End up at `/exemption/site-details-added` (the "Your sites" page)
2. **Manual entry sites** → Complete the flow → End up at `/exemption/task-list` (bypassing the "Your sites" page entirely)

**The Problem:**
- Manual entry sites are stored as individual session variables (`manual-site-name-text-input`, etc.)
- File upload sites are stored in the `sites` array
- The "Your sites" page only reads from the `sites` array
- Manual entry's "Save and continue" goes directly to task-list, **not** to site-details-added

**Current Routing Mismatch:**
- The manual entry review page template has `<form action="../site-details-added" method="post">` 
- But the route handler `review-site-details-router` redirects to `../task-list`
- So manual entry users never see the "Your sites" page where both journey types should be combined

**What happens if both are used:**
- File upload sites appear on "Your sites" page
- Manual entry sites are completely invisible on "Your sites" page  
- Users can't see a unified view of all their sites
- The site numbering would be broken because manual sites start counting from 1 independently

Should I proceed to the next question about site numbering logic?

---

**User**

Yes

---

**Cursor**

## Question 3: Site numbering logic - Is there currently a centralized way to determine the next available site number? How does deletion work for file upload sites, and should manual sites be deletable too?

Let me examine how site numbering works in both journeys and look at the deletion functionality.

Now let me look at how manual entry handles site numbering:

Now let me check how file upload sites determine the next site number when adding new sites:

Let me look at how sites are added to the array in the file upload journey:

Now I have enough information to answer question 3:

## Answer: Site numbering logic and deletion functionality

**File Upload Sites:**
- **Site numbering**: Uses `sites.length` to determine the next site number
- **When adding sites**: `sites.push()` adds to end of array, numbering is automatic based on array index + 1
- **When deleting sites**: Uses `sites.splice(siteIndex - 1, 1)` to remove from array
- **After deletion**: All subsequent sites automatically shift down (e.g., if site 2 is deleted, site 3 becomes site 2)
- **Site numbering stays sequential**: Always 1, 2, 3, etc. with no gaps

**Manual Entry Sites:**
- **Site numbering**: Uses `manual-current-site` session variable to track highest site number
- **When adding sites**: Scans session variables (`manual-site-name-text-input`, `manual-site-2-name-text-input`, etc.) to find highest existing site, then adds 1
- **When deleting sites**: **No deletion functionality exists** - there are no delete routes for manual entry sites
- **Site numbering can have gaps**: If a site was added but never completed, gaps could exist

**Key Issues with Current Approach:**

1. **No centralized site numbering logic** - each journey counts independently
2. **Different deletion capabilities**: 
   - File upload sites can be deleted ✅
   - Manual entry sites cannot be deleted ❌
3. **Conflicting numbering systems**:
   - File upload: Dynamic numbering based on array position
   - Manual entry: Fixed numbering based on variable names
4. **No coordination between journeys**: If you have 3 file upload sites, manual entry would still start from site 1

**Current Deletion Routes (File Upload Only):**
- `GET /delete-site?site={number}&return={page}` - Confirmation page
- `POST /delete-site-router` - Performs deletion and redirects back

**Manual Entry Missing Functionality:**
- No delete confirmation pages
- No delete route handlers  
- No way to remove incorrectly entered manual sites

Should I proceed to the next question about site ordering priority?

**User**

## Question 4: Site ordering priority - You mentioned "after the file upload sites if any have been loaded" - should this always be the case, or should it be based on the order they were added chronologically?

Let me examine if there's any existing logic that tracks when sites were added or any timestamps in the current implementation.

Let me check if there's any specific discussion or documentation about the intended user flow for mixing file upload and manual entry:

Let me check the current check-answers page to see how sites are expected to be displayed there:

Let me continue reading to see how sites are displayed in the check-answers page:

Now let me look at the "how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates" page to understand the intended user journey:

Based on my analysis, I can now answer your fourth question:

## Answer: Site ordering priority and intended user flow

**Current Implementation Analysis:**

1. **No existing timestamp/chronological tracking**: There's no `created` timestamp, `addedTime`, or order tracking in either journey
2. **Check-answers page expects file upload sites only**: The template only loops through `data.sites` array (file upload sites)
3. **No mixed journey UI considerations**: The current interface doesn't account for users switching between methods

**Current User Flow Reveals Intended Ordering:**

Looking at the coordinate method selection page (`how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates.html`), users choose **either**:
- "Upload a file with the coordinates of the site"  
- "Enter the coordinates of the site manually"

This suggests the **intended design is one method per session**, not mixing both approaches.

**However, the prompt mentions supporting mixed journeys**, which means we need to decide on ordering:

**Option A: File Upload First (Static Priority)**
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable numbering
- **Cons**: Doesn't reflect actual user timeline if they upload file after manual entry

**Option B: Chronological Order**
- **Pros**: Reflects actual user interaction timeline, more intuitive
- **Cons**: More complex to implement, requires tracking timestamps

**Option C: User Choice**
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility
- **Cons**: Adds UI complexity

**My Recommendation: File Upload First (Option A)**

**Reasoning:**
1. **File uploads typically contain multiple sites** - makes sense to number them first (1,2,3...)
2. **Manual entry typically adds individual sites** - logical to append after bulk upload (4,5,6...)  
3. **Simpler implementation** - no need for timestamps
4. **Consistent with current "Your sites" button behavior** - "Add another site" suggests appending to existing list
5. **Matches bulk-then-individual workflow** - users likely upload file first, then manually add exceptions

**Implementation approach:** Always show file upload sites first (sites 1,2,3...) followed by manual entry sites (continuing the sequence).

Should I proceed to the next question about the check answers format differences?

---

**User**

Regarding the last question - sites can be added in any order and should be listed in chronological order. When the Add another site button on the common to both journey Your sites page is selected it goes back to this page `/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates` where either option can be selected

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the clarification! That completely changes the approach and makes much more sense from a user experience perspective.

## Revised Answer: Site ordering should be chronological

**Corrected Understanding:**
- Users can alternate between file upload and manual entry methods freely
- "Add another site" → goes to `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates` → user chooses either method again  
- Sites should be listed in **chronological order** (order they were actually added)

**Example User Journey:**
1. Upload file → Sites 1, 2, 3 (from file)
2. "Add another site" → Manual entry → Site 4 (manual)
3. "Add another site" → Upload another file → Sites 5, 6 (from second file)  
4. "Add another site" → Manual entry → Site 7 (manual)

**Implementation Requirements:**
We need to track **addition order**, which means:

1. **Add timestamps or sequence numbers** to each site when created
2. **Unified site storage** - merge both file upload and manual entry sites into a single ordered list
3. **Chronological display** - sort sites by addition time on "Your sites" and "Check answers" pages
4. **Sequential numbering** - assign site numbers based on chronological order (1, 2, 3...)

**Technical Approach:**
- Add `addedAt` timestamp or `sequence` number when sites are created
- Convert manual entry sites to the same data structure as file upload sites
- Merge and sort both types chronologically for display
- Ensure deletion re-numbers correctly while maintaining chronological order

This is much better UX - users see sites in the order they actually added them, regardless of method used.

Should I proceed to the next question about check answers format differences?

**User**

Yes

## Question 5: Check answers format - What specifically is different about the "check answers format" vs the review page format? Are there different data fields or presentation styles?

Let me compare the manual entry review page format with the check-answers page format to identify the key differences.

Now let me compare this with the check-answers format I saw earlier. Let me focus on the key structural and data differences:

Now let me look at the specific check-answers page again to see what fields it shows for file upload sites vs what manual entry tracks:

## Answer: Check answers format differences vs review page format

Based on my comparison, here are the key differences between the **manual entry review page** and the **check answers page** formats:

### **Data Fields Shown:**

**Manual Entry Review Page Shows:**
1. ✅ Site name  
2. ✅ Activity dates (conditional)
3. ✅ Activity description (conditional) 
4. ✅ Method of providing site location
5. ✅ **Coordinate system** (WGS84/OSGB36 + Lat/Long vs Eastings/Northings)
6. ✅ **Specific coordinates** (actual lat/long or eastings/northings values)
7. ✅ **Site width** (for circular sites)
8. ✅ **Multiple coordinate points** (Point 1, Point 2, etc. for boundary sites)
9. ✅ Map view

**Check Answers Page Shows:**
1. ✅ Site name
2. ✅ Activity dates  
3. ✅ Activity description
4. ✅ Method of providing site location
5. ✅ **File uploaded** (filename for file upload sites)
6. ❌ **No coordinate system details**
7. ❌ **No specific coordinates shown**
8. ❌ **No site width shown**
9. ❌ **No individual coordinate points shown**
10. ✅ Map view

### **Presentation Style Differences:**

**Manual Entry Review Page:**
- **Incomplete data handling**: Shows `<span class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Incomplete</span>` tags
- **Conditional field display**: Only shows fields relevant to user's choices
- **Change/Add links**: Dynamic link text based on whether data exists
- **Detailed coordinate breakdown**: Shows each coordinate pair individually
- **Technical coordinate details**: Shows coordinate system with explanation

**Check Answers Page:**
- **Clean final summary**: No incomplete tags, assumes all data complete
- **Simplified display**: Higher-level summary without technical details
- **Static Change links**: Always says "Change"
- **Aggregated coordinate info**: Shows method + filename, not individual coordinates
- **User-friendly format**: Less technical, more outcome-focused

### **Key Implications for Manual Entry Sites:**

Manual entry sites need to be **simplified** for check answers:
- Don't show individual coordinate values
- Don't show coordinate system details  
- Don't show site width separately
- Summarize as "Method: Manually entered coordinates" or similar
- Keep the map view but remove technical coordinate breakdown

This suggests check answers is for **final review/submission**, while review pages are for **detailed editing**.

Should I proceed to the next question about navigation flow when users click "Add another site"?

**User**

Analyse the attached image. It's an example of the check answer page with 1 file upload with 4 sites and 
2 manually entered coordinate points with a circular width. As you've noticed there are only site specific cards with a summary of the details and no seperate cards even if activity dates and details are the same - they are contained within each card. Does that help?

---

**Cursor**

Thank you! That image is extremely helpful and clarifies the check answers format completely.

## Revised Answer: Check answers format vs review page format

**Key Structural Difference I Missed:**

The check answers page uses a **flat, site-centric structure** where:
- **Each site gets its own complete summary card**
- **All information is duplicated in each site card** (even if activity dates/descriptions are the same across sites)
- **No separate "Activity details" card** showing meta-settings

**Manual Entry Review Page Structure:**
```
📋 Activity Details Card
   ├─ Are activity dates same for every site?
   ├─ Activity dates (if same for all)
   ├─ Are activity descriptions same for every site? 
   └─ Activity description (if same for all)

📍 Site 1 Details Card
   ├─ Site name
   ├─ Activity dates (only if different per site)
   ├─ Activity description (only if different per site)
   ├─ Method/coordinate system/coordinates
   └─ Map

📍 Site 2 Details Card (etc.)
```

**Check Answers Page Structure:**
```
📍 Site 1 Details Card
   ├─ Site name
   ├─ Activity dates (always shown)
   ├─ Activity description (always shown)
   ├─ Method of providing site location
   ├─ File uploaded OR coordinate system details
   └─ Map

📍 Site 2 Details Card
   ├─ Site name  
   ├─ Activity dates (duplicated if same)
   ├─ Activity description (duplicated if same)
   ├─ Method of providing site location
   ├─ File uploaded OR coordinate system details
   └─ Map
```

**For Manual Entry Sites in Check Answers:**
Looking at your image, manual sites show:
- **Coordinate system details** (e.g., "WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984)")
- **Actual coordinate values** and **width information**
- This is more detailed than I initially thought

**Implementation Impact:**
When converting manual entry sites for check answers, we need to:
1. **Flatten the structure** - no separate activity details card
2. **Duplicate shared information** in each site card  
3. **Include coordinate details** (not just "manually entered")
4. **Show coordinate system + actual coordinates + width** for manual sites
5. **Show filename** for file upload sites

This means manual entry sites will actually show **more detail** in check answers than I originally thought, not less!

Should I proceed to the next question about navigation flow?

```plaintext
📋 Activity Details Card
   ├─ Are activity dates same for every site?
   ├─ Activity dates (if same for all)
   ├─ Are activity descriptions same for every site? 
   └─ Activity description (if same for all)

📍 Site 1 Details Card
   ├─ Site name
   ├─ Activity dates (only if different per site)
   ├─ Activity description (only if different per site)
   ├─ Method/coordinate system/coordinates
   └─ Map

📍 Site 2 Details Card (etc.)
```

```plaintext
📍 Site 1 Details Card
   ├─ Site name
   ├─ Activity dates (always shown)
   ├─ Activity description (always shown)
   ├─ Method of providing site location
   ├─ File uploaded OR coordinate system details
   └─ Map

📍 Site 2 Details Card
   ├─ Site name  
   ├─ Activity dates (duplicated if same)
   ├─ Activity description (duplicated if same)
   ├─ Method of providing site location
   ├─ File uploaded OR coordinate system details
   └─ Map
```

## Question 6: Navigation flow - When users click "Add another site" from site-details-added, should they be able to choose between file upload or manual entry again? Should there be any restrictions on mixing the two approaches?

Based on your earlier clarification, I understand that "Add another site" should go to `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates` where users can choose either method again. But let me examine the current implementation and ask about potential restrictions or considerations:

I can see the current "Add another site" button doesn't have an `href` or click handler. Let me check if there's a route for this:

Based on your clarification and the current implementation, I can see the navigation flow needs to be implemented. Let me ask about specific considerations:

## Answer: Navigation flow - Mixed approach considerations

**Current State:**
- The "Add another site" button exists but has no navigation implemented
- You've confirmed it should go to `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates`
- Users should be able to choose either method again

**Questions about restrictions and considerations:**

1. **File upload limitations**: If a user uploads a file with multiple sites, then wants to add individual sites, should there be any warnings about mixing bulk vs individual approaches?

2. **Shared settings conflicts**: What happens if:
   - User sets "activity dates same for all sites" in file upload journey 
   - Then adds manual sites with different dates
   - Do we need to handle this conflict or just treat manual sites as always having individual settings?

3. **Context preservation**: When returning to `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates`, should the page:
   - Show any indication that sites already exist?
   - Clear previous session data from the other journey type?
   - Maintain any shared settings (activity dates/descriptions) from previous sites?

4. **Validation complexity**: Should there be any restrictions like:
   - Maximum total number of sites across both methods?
   - Warning if user has many sites already and tries to upload a large file?

5. **Error handling**: If user uploads a file with duplicate site names or conflicting data, how should this be handled when manual sites already exist?

**My recommendation** would be a **fully permissive approach** - let users freely switch between methods with chronological ordering, but I want to confirm if you foresee any specific edge cases or restrictions needed.

Should I proceed to the next question about data persistence and editing capabilities?

**User**

Here are my responses to the questions above appended to the end of them:


Questions about restrictions and considerations:
1. File upload limitations: If a user uploads a file with multiple sites, then wants to add individual sites, should there be any warnings about mixing bulk vs individual approaches? NO
2. Shared settings conflicts: What happens if:
* User sets "activity dates same for all sites" in file upload journey: The existing flow works perfectly, currently it’s setup so the pretend file has 4 sites and they can specify whether dates and activities are the same or different in any combination. They then add anything missing from the review page 
* Then adds manual sites with different dates: The manual journey also works perfectly they can do different/the same. This should stay as is and independent from each other, and per each manual or file upload journey
* Do we need to handle this conflict or just treat manual sites as always having individual settings? See previous statements - always independent and user can do what they want as per current functionality
1. Context preservation: When returning to /how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates, should the page:
* Show any indication that sites already exist? The journey pages should be clean of any previous data. Sites will be present in the Your sites page.
* Clear previous session data from the other journey type? Yes
* Maintain any shared settings (activity dates/descriptions) from previous sites? No, only if it is in an active file upload session with multiple sites/manual entry when the user would have specified during those particular journeys whether dates/descriptsion are different/the same
1. Validation complexity: Should there be any restrictions like:
* Maximum total number of sites across both methods? No
* Warning if user has many sites already and tries to upload a large file? This is a prototype - no files uploaded we are pretending as per the current file upload page
1. Error handling: If user uploads a file with duplicate site names or conflicting data, how should this be handled when manual sites already exist? See above
My recommendation would be a fully permissive approach - let users freely switch between methods with chronological ordering, but I want to confirm if you foresee any specific edge cases or restrictions needed.
Should I proceed to the next question about data persistence and editing capabilities?We should probably come up with some rules about file upload. As I said it’s a prototype. So currently if they upload a file there are 4 sites that have 2 site names missing and the user decides whether dates/activities are the same/different. Let’s stick too that one - but they might do the file upload 1st or after adding some sites manually. If they do another file upload, let’s say the pretend file has 2 sites and the site names are present - clear?

**Cursor**

Perfect! Thank you for the clear responses. Let me confirm my understanding:

## Confirmed Navigation Flow Approach:

**Fully Permissive + Independent Journeys:**
- ✅ No warnings about mixing approaches
- ✅ Each journey (file upload session or manual entry session) operates independently  
- ✅ File upload can set "same dates/activities for all sites" and manual entry can independently set "same dates/activities for all sites"
- ✅ Clean journey starts - no carryover of settings between methods
- ✅ No site count restrictions
- ✅ Chronological ordering in final display

**Prototype File Upload Rules:**
- **First file upload**: 4 sites, 2 missing site names, user decides same/different dates/activities  
- **Subsequent file uploads**: 2 sites, site names present, user decides same/different dates/activities
- **Can happen**: Before any manual sites OR after manual sites have been added

**Implementation Flow:**
1. "Add another site" → `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates`  
2. User picks method → Clean journey start (no previous session data)
3. Complete that journey → Sites added chronologically to unified list
4. Return to "Your sites" page with all sites in chronological order

**Clear Session Data Between Journeys:**
- When starting file upload: Clear any manual entry session variables
- When starting manual entry: Clear any file upload session variables  
- Keep only the unified sites list with timestamps for chronological ordering

This approach gives users maximum flexibility while keeping each individual journey clean and simple.

Should I proceed to Question 7 about data persistence and editing capabilities?

## Question 7: Data persistence and editing capabilities - Should users be able to edit/delete sites from either journey once they're on the "Your sites" page? What happens if someone wants to add more sites after reaching check-answers?

Let me examine the current editing and deletion capabilities to understand what needs to be implemented:

Now let me check what the check-answers page looks like for adding more sites:

Perfect! I can see that the check-answers page has "Change" links that go back to `review-site-details?site={{ loop.index }}&camefromcheckanswers=true`. This is the existing editing flow. Now let me ask about the specific capabilities needed:

## Question 7: Data persistence and editing capabilities

**Current Editing Capabilities:**

**"Your Sites" Page:**
- ✅ **Review** link → `review-site-details?site={{ siteIndex }}#site-{{ siteIndex }}-details`
- ✅ **Delete** link → `delete-site?site={{ siteIndex }}&return=site-details-added` (file upload sites only)

**Check Answers Page:**
- ✅ **Change** link per site → `review-site-details?site={{ loop.index }}&camefromcheckanswers=true`

**Questions for Implementation:**

1. **Deletion Parity**: Should manual entry sites be deletable from "Your sites" page like file upload sites are?
   - Currently only file upload sites can be deleted
   - Manual entry sites have no delete functionality

2. **Cross-Journey Editing**: If a user added a site via file upload, should they be able to:
   - Edit it using the manual entry forms? 
   - Or should editing always use the original entry method?

3. **Edit Flow Routing**: When editing from "Your sites" page:
   - Should it detect the site's original entry method and route accordingly?
   - Or always use a unified editing interface?

4. **Adding Sites from Check Answers**: Currently check-answers has "Change" links for existing sites, but:
   - Is there a way to add **new sites** from the check-answers page?
   - Should there be an "Add another site" button on check-answers?

5. **Data Consistency**: When editing sites that were created in a group (e.g., file upload with "same dates for all"), what happens to the shared settings if one site is edited individually?

6. **Site Re-ordering**: If sites are deleted and the numbering changes (Site 1,2,3 → delete Site 2 → now Site 1,3), should:
   - Sites automatically renumber (1,2)?
   - Or maintain original chronological order with gaps?

**My initial thinking** is that users should be able to freely edit and delete any site regardless of how it was created, but I want to understand your preferences for these edge cases.

Questions for Implementation:
1. Deletion Parity: Should manual entry sites be deletable from "Your sites" page like file upload sites are? Yes, and from the manual entry review site details page
* Currently only file upload sites can be deleted
* Manual entry sites have no delete functionality
1. Cross-Journey Editing: If a user added a site via file upload, should they be able to:
* Edit it using the manual entry forms? Answer:If they select Change from Method of providing site location on the review site details page after uploading a file and then select manual entry then they go through the manual entry route and start afresh - all data entered forgotten. They are starting again
* Or should editing always use the original entry method? See above
1. Edit Flow Routing: When editing from "Your sites" page:
* Should it detect the site's original entry method and route accordingly? Answer: Selecting Review from the Your sites page just takes them back the the original Review site page that the site was on along with the other sites that were in that particular site adding journey
* Or always use a unified editing interface?
1. Adding Sites from Check Answers: Currently check-answers has "Change" links for existing sites, but:
* Is there a way to add new sites from the check-answers page? Answer: Change goes back appropriate review site details like how I mentioned above. If they want to add new sites they would need to click on the link `Go back to your project` which takes them to the task list, then click Site details which goes to Your sites where they can add a site. 
* Should there be an "Add another site" button on check-answers? No, see above
1. Data Consistency: When editing sites that were created in a group (e.g., file upload with "same dates for all"), what happens to the shared settings if one site is edited individually? I don’t understand, please clarify
2. Site Re-ordering: If sites are deleted and the numbering changes (Site 1,2,3 → delete Site 2 → now Site 1,3), should:
* Sites automatically renumber (1,2)? Yes. They currently do on the file upload review sites page and the Your sites page when a file has been uploaded
* Or maintain original chronological order with gaps? See above
My initial thinking is that users should be able to freely edit and delete any site regardless of how it was created, but I want to understand your preferences for these edge cases.

Great clarifications! Let me clarify the **Data Consistency** question:

## Data Consistency Clarification

**Scenario:** User uploads a file with 4 sites and chooses "Activity dates are the same for every site" = Yes, with dates "1 May 2025 to 15 May 2025"

**All 4 sites inherit these shared dates:**
- Site 1: 1 May 2025 to 15 May 2025 ✅ (from shared setting)
- Site 2: 1 May 2025 to 15 May 2025 ✅ (from shared setting) 
- Site 3: 1 May 2025 to 15 May 2025 ✅ (from shared setting)
- Site 4: 1 May 2025 to 15 May 2025 ✅ (from shared setting)

**Then user clicks "Change" on Site 2's activity dates and changes them to "10 May 2025 to 20 May 2025"**

**Questions:**
1. Does the shared setting "Activity dates are the same for every site" automatically change to "No"?
2. Do Sites 1, 3, and 4 keep their original dates (1-15 May)?
3. Does Site 2 now have individual dates (10-20 May)?

**Or:**
1. Does changing one site's dates force the user to re-answer "Are dates the same for every site?"
2. If they choose "No", do they then have to set individual dates for all 4 sites?

**Same question applies to activity descriptions.**

**Example of the dilemma:**
- **Before editing**: "Same dates for all" = Yes → all sites show shared dates
- **After editing Site 2**: What happens to the "same for all" setting and the other sites?

Does this clarify what I meant by data consistency? How should this conflict between shared settings and individual edits be handled?

**User**

Are you talksing about the review site details pages here?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, exactly! I'm talking about the **file upload review-site-details page** (like `/exemption/review-site-details?site=1`).

**The specific scenario:**

1. User uploads file → 4 sites created
2. User sets "Activity dates are the same for every site" = **Yes** 
3. User sets shared dates = "1 May to 15 May 2025"
4. **On the review-site-details page**, all 4 site cards show those same dates
5. User clicks **"Change"** link next to Site 2's activity dates
6. User changes Site 2's dates to "10 May to 20 May 2025"

**Question:** When they return to the review-site-details page, what happens?

- Does Site 2 now show different dates while Sites 1,3,4 keep the original shared dates?
- Does the "Activity dates are the same for every site" setting automatically flip to "No"?
- Or does editing one site force them to reconfigure the whole group?

**Same question for activity descriptions.**

This is about maintaining data consistency on the **review-site-details page** when individual sites are edited after being created with shared settings.

Is this the scenario you want me to clarify about?

**User**

This is currently working perfectly in both journeys so you might want to reanalyse those pages

1st screen shows the Activity details card where common dates and description are dispalyed. 2nd screen shows if dates are different. 3rd one when both different. As I said those work perfectly now so keep as is

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Thank you for the screenshots - this completely clarifies it. I can see the current file upload review-site-details page **already handles data consistency perfectly**:

## Current Implementation Works Correctly:

**Screenshot 1 - Shared Settings:**
- ✅ Activity details card shows shared dates/description
- ✅ Individual site cards **don't duplicate** the shared information
- ✅ Clean, non-redundant display

**Screenshot 2 - Mixed Settings (dates different, description same):**
- ✅ "Activity dates same for every site?" = **No** → dates move to individual site cards as "Incomplete/Add"
- ✅ "Activity description same for every site?" = **Yes** → description stays in Activity details card
- ✅ Perfect conditional display logic

**Screenshot 3 - Individual Settings:**
- ✅ Both dates and descriptions move to individual site cards when set to "No"
- ✅ Activity details card only shows the toggle questions
- ✅ Each site gets its own "Add" links for missing data

## Understanding Confirmed:

The current logic is **exactly right** - when users change the "same/different" toggles, the fields automatically move between:
- **Activity details card** (shared)
- **Individual site cards** (site-specific)

I was overthinking this! The current file upload implementation should be preserved exactly as-is, and manual entry should follow the same pattern.

**No data consistency issues to solve** - it's already working perfectly.

Should I proceed to the final questions about technical constraints and route handling?

**User**

Great! And yes

## Question 8: Technical constraints and route handling - Are there any specific routing patterns or conventions I should be aware of? Should manual entry sites use the same deletion/editing mechanisms as file upload sites?

Let me examine the current routing patterns to understand the technical constraints:

Let me check the specific technical patterns used for deletion and editing:

Now let me check if there are any specific naming conventions or patterns for session data management:

Based on my analysis, here are the technical constraints and questions:

## Question 8: Technical constraints and route handling

**Current Routing Patterns I Can See:**

1. **Route naming convention**: `page-name` (GET) + `page-name-router` (POST)
2. **Manual entry prefix**: All manual routes use `/manual-entry/` prefix
3. **Session data naming**: Manual entry uses `manual-` prefix (e.g., `manual-current-site`)
4. **File upload routes**: Use main `/exemption/` path without prefix

**Technical Questions:**

1. **Unified vs separate routes**: Should manual entry sites use existing file upload edit/delete routes, or should I create separate manual entry versions?
   - E.g., `/delete-site` vs `/manual-entry/delete-site`

2. **Session data standards**: Should I follow the existing `manual-` naming convention for new session variables, or move to a unified naming system?

3. **Route parameter handling**: File upload uses `?site={{ siteIndex }}` - should manual sites follow the same pattern or use a different approach for site identification?

4. **Return routing**: File upload uses `&return=site-details-added` - should manual entry use the same return parameter system?

5. **Data conversion points**: Where should the conversion happen from manual session variables to the unified `sites` array structure?
   - In the route handlers?
   - When displaying pages?
   - When saving to the unified list?

6. **Error handling consistency**: Should manual entry deletion/editing use the same error patterns as file upload routes?

7. **Backwards compatibility**: Are there any concerns about maintaining existing session data or route patterns during the integration?

**My initial recommendation** would be to reuse existing delete/edit route infrastructure where possible, but I want to understand if there are specific technical preferences or constraints I should follow.

I'm not technical so I'll take your recommendations on what is best. Before you proceed will you be able to collate everything we've specified here into a single prompt - remember we started this chat off with an unfinished prompt from me

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! I'll collate everything we've discovered and specified into a comprehensive single prompt. Here it is:

---

# Context
In the 'multiple-site-v2' version of the prototype for the manual-entry journey where there is more than one site (/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/manual-entry/does-your-project-involve-more-than-one-site), we have so far added the ability to add a site which appears on the/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/manual-entry/review-site-details page and then by selecting Add the next site button loop around adding more sites that appear on the review page and the Site numbering works perfectly.

When Save and continue is elected the Your sites page /versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/manual-entry/site-details-added is loaded where the sites will appear.

The routing for manual entry is here: app/routes/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption-manual-entry.js

Currently only the sites that have been added via the file upload journey appear on this page so we need to add in the manual entry sites too and in the right order - so after the file upload sites if any have been loaded or just the manual entry sites if no file uploaded sites have been added etc.

The file upload journey starts here /multiple-sites-v2/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates when Upload a file with the coordinates of the site and continues through the main /multiple-sites-v2/exemption/ up until the review page which is here: app/views/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/review-site-details.html. The routing for that is app/routes/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption.js. This works perfectly (but just for one file upload at the moment)

Sites also appear on the app/views/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/check-answers-multiple-sites.html page which could also contain file upload and manual entry sites.

Currently on the file upload journey sites can be deleted so there is a site counter thing that works out what number each site should be.

The `Add another site` button on the `/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/site-details-added` page needs to take users to the `/versions/multiple-sites-v2/exemption/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates` page

# Analysis phase

## Current Data Storage
**File Upload Sites:**
- Stored in `req.session.data['sites']` as an array of objects
- Each site object has properties: `name`, `startDate` (object with day/month/year), `endDate`, `description`

**Manual Entry Sites:**
- Stored as individual session variables with naming pattern:
- Site 1: `manual-site-name-text-input`, `manual-start-date-date-input-day/month/year`, etc.
- Site 2+: `manual-site-2-name-text-input`, `manual-site-2-start-date-date-input-day/month/year`, etc.
- Uses `manual-current-site` to track highest site number

## Current User Journey Issues
**File upload sites** → Complete flow → End up at `/exemption/site-details-added` (Your sites page)
**Manual entry sites** → Complete flow → End up at `/exemption/task-list` (bypassing Your sites page)

**Problem:** Manual entry review page template has `<form action="../site-details-added">` but route handler redirects to `../task-list`

## Site Numbering Logic
**File Upload:** Uses `sites.length` for numbering, `sites.splice()` for deletion, automatic renumbering
**Manual Entry:** Uses `manual-current-site` variable, no deletion functionality exists

## Site Ordering Requirements
- Sites can be added in any order and should be listed in **chronological order**
- "Add another site" → `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates` → user chooses either method
- Need timestamps/sequence numbers for chronological ordering

## Check Answers Format Differences
**Manual Entry Review Page:** Shows detailed coordinate info, technical details, incomplete tags, conditional field display
**Check Answers Page:** Flat site-centric structure, each site gets complete summary card, duplicates shared info across sites, shows coordinate system + actual coordinates + width for manual sites

# Implementation phase

## Core Requirements
1. **Unified site display**: Manual entry sites must appear on Your sites page (`site-details-added.html`)
2. **Chronological ordering**: Sites displayed in order they were actually added, regardless of method
3. **Routing fix**: Manual entry "Save and continue" must go to `site-details-added`, not `task-list`
4. **Cross-journey navigation**: "Add another site" → coordinate method choice → clean journey start

## Data Structure Changes
1. **Add timestamps**: Track when each site was created for chronological ordering
2. **Unified storage**: Convert manual entry sites to same structure as file upload sites
3. **Session management**: Clear previous journey data when starting new method

## Site Management Features
1. **Deletion parity**: Manual entry sites must be deletable from Your sites page and manual entry review page
2. **Unified editing**: Selecting "Review" goes back to original review page with other sites from that journey
3. **Method switching**: Changing "Method of providing site location" starts fresh with new method, forgetting all previous data
4. **Auto-renumbering**: Sites automatically renumber (1,2,3) when sites are deleted

## Navigation Flow
1. **From Your sites**: "Add another site" → `/how-do-you-want-to-provide-the-coordinates`
2. **From check-answers**: "Change" → appropriate review-site-details page; to add sites → "Go back to your project" → task list → Site details → Your sites
3. **Independent journeys**: Each file upload session or manual entry session operates independently
4. **Clean starts**: Starting new method clears previous journey session data

## File Upload Prototype Rules
- **First file upload**: 4 sites, 2 missing site names, user decides same/different dates/activities
- **Subsequent file uploads**: 2 sites, site names present, user decides same/different dates/activities
- **Can happen**: Before any manual sites OR after manual sites have been added

## Check Answers Integration
- Convert manual entry sites to check answers format: site-centric cards with duplicated shared information
- Show coordinate system details + actual coordinates + width for manual sites  
- Show filename for file upload sites
- Maintain existing conditional display logic (same dates/descriptions settings)

# Verification phase

## Technical Validation
1. **Route patterns**: Follow existing conventions (page-name + page-name-router, manual-entry prefix)
2. **Session data**: Follow existing `manual-` naming convention
3. **Parameter handling**: Use existing `?site={{ siteIndex }}` and `&return=site-details-added` patterns
4. **Error handling**: Use existing error patterns and deletion/editing mechanisms

## User Journey Testing
1. **Mixed journey flows**: File upload → manual entry → file upload → manual entry
2. **Deletion and renumbering**: Verify sites renumber correctly when deleted
3. **Editing capabilities**: Test Review links go to correct original review pages
4. **Method switching**: Verify changing location method starts fresh
5. **Chronological ordering**: Confirm sites appear in order added, not by method type

## Data Consistency
1. **Preserve existing logic**: Keep current file upload review-site-details conditional display (shared vs individual dates/descriptions)
2. **Cross-journey compatibility**: Ensure manual and file upload sites coexist properly
3. **Session persistence**: Verify site data persists correctly during journey switches

## Edge Cases
1. **Empty states**: No sites, only manual sites, only file upload sites
2. **Incomplete sites**: Mixed complete/incomplete sites across both journeys  
3. **Navigation edge cases**: Back button behavior, URL manipulation, returning from task list
4. **File upload variants**: First upload (4 sites) vs subsequent uploads (2 sites)
