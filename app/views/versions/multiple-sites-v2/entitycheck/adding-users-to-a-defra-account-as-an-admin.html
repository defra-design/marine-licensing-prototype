        How to add users to your Defra account as an admin
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        As an account admin you can invite and remove other team members or third parties and manage a Defra account. You can also give admin rights to other team members.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        We recommend there are at least 2 account admins to prevent issues accessing and managing the account.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Adding users is a 2-step process. First you invite the user to join the account as a team member or intermediary user and give them account access.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Once they've registered you then assign them service access which will either be as an admin or standard user. Intermediaries can only be added as standard users and cannot access the account dashboard.
      </p>
