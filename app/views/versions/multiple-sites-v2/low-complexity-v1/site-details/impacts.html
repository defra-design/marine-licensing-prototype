To reduce this impact advance notice will be given to these businesses, work will only be carried out off-season and beach access will be maintained where possible.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">For example, the impact of the activity is there may be disturbance to overwintering birds. To reduce this impact work will be avoided at a time of year when certain species are present.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">For example, the impact of the activity is noise or disturbance to coastal communities. To reduce this impact advance notice will be given to residents and work will only happen during the day.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">For example, this is routine maintenance of an existing pontoon, replacing worn fixings and boards. The impacts were assessed by inspecting the site and reviewing previous maintenance records. The work uses hand tools only, all materials stay on the pontoon structure, and nothing will enter the water. There will be no impact on the seabed or marine life, or to neighbouring properties or businesses.</p>
