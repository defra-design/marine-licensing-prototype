        <p>This prototype is made using the <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a> and components and patterns from the the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User journeys in this prototype</h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Check if you need a marine licence</li>
          <li>The exemption notification journey</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The 'Check if you need a marine licence' journey guides users through a series of questions and helps them determine whether their marine activity requires a licence or is exempt.</p>

        <p>Exempt activities do not require a marine licence but MMO need to be notified of the activity.</p>

        <!--<p>[Link to Mural board to show the mapped out user journeys]</p>-->

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Drawing on a map</h2>

        <p>For drawing a location/site on a map, the prototype uses the map software that the 2024 alpha were using and developing. This has some limitations in terms of usability and accessibility and we have been investigating other fully accessible and more usable options that could be used instead, including the Flood risk map that is being developed within Defra.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prototype limitations</h2>

        <p>If you see a page titled 'Journey end' it means either a feature you've selected isn't available or you need to go back and answer a question differently.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Clearing session data</h2>

        <p>For the prototype to function and display correctly, the data entered during a session is saved. If you revisit a journey without clearing this data, the prototype will not function correctly. To ensure it does, you must clear the data each time. You can do this using the 'Clear data' link in the footer and on the index page.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iteration 1</h2>

        <p>The 'Check if you need a licence' journey that allows for the scenario relating to removal of sediment from the sea bed for scientific research. When the questions have been successfully answered the 2nd part is the exemption notification journey where details of the activity are entered.</p>

        <p>It's a linear journey with no account creation or sign in required.</p>

        <p>The 'Check if you need a licence' journey is an existing live service, so our Content Designer reviewed the questions to ensure they align with the Government Digital Service style guide, restructuring them where necessary. Some questions were also removed because they repeated information users had already provided. <a href="https://defra.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/Team4307/Change%20Delivery%20%20Implementation/MMO%20CHANGE%20PROGRAMME/MPLP%20(Marine%20Planning%20%26%20Licensing%20Programme)/ALPHA/Content/Content%20decisions/Exemptions%20prototype%20content%20decision%20log.xlsx?d=webd2d010168a4a2c9e2d0edf69fb4ea3&csf=1&web=1&e=6RLHix">Read the content change log</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="/versions/2025-01-27/check/marine-protected-areas">The Marine Protected Areas (MPA) question</a> links to an arcgis mapping tool which has various layers on it to help identify different areas. This is linked to from the live service, but in the prototype the map loads with only the MPA layer visible, rather than all of them, which is currently the case in live.</p>

        <p>The available location details options are draw on a map and specify the centre of a square and its width.</p>

            <p>You're looking to carry out some research involving analysis of sediments from just off the coast of Worthing, by the pier.</p>
            <p>You need to carry out a survey taking 1 sample within 100m of the pier.</p>
            <p>You'll travel to the sample sites by boat and lower a grab overboard.</p>
            <p>The grab will be used to extract 0.3m<sup>3</sup> of material from the surface of the sea floor.</p>
            <p>The material removed will be returned to the vessel and taken anyway for testing and analysis.</p>
            <p>The material will be disposed to land once testing and analysis is complete.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iteration 2</h2>

        <p>Based on the UR feedback some of the 'Check if you need a marine licence' questions were updated with <a href="https://defra.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/Team4307/Change%20Delivery%20%20Implementation/MMO%20CHANGE%20PROGRAMME/MPLP%20(Marine%20Planning%20%26%20Licensing%20Programme)/ALPHA/Content/Content%20decisions/Exemptions%20prototype%20content%20decision%20log.xlsx?d=webd2d010168a4a2c9e2d0edf69fb4ea3&csf=1&web=1&e=6RLHix">different or new content</a>, but we also added in new pages to allow us to test a different scenario more appropriate for novice users - pontoon construction in a residential setting.</p>

        <p>Features added:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>File with coordinates upload options, with KML file upload the one that works</li>
          <li>Specifying centre of a circle and it's width as the location</li>
          <li>Manually entering multiple coordinates of the area</li>
          <li>Specifying which coordinate system is used for coordinate entry (WGS84 or OSGB36)</li>
          <li>'Check answers' and 'Review your location' now uses Cards style summary lists, with location changes happening only on the 'Review your location' page with a single link to that page from 'Check answers'</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We didn't have time to iterate all the recommendations from all the UR feedback (specifically dates guidance and duplication of project and activity details), as we were waiting for a response from the legal team.</p>

        <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iteration 3</h2>

        <p>For this iteration we wanted to explore users needing a Defra account to send the exemption notification information. Part of the reason being enabling users to save and comeback later - for example if they needed to get coordinates or check on the dates of the activity.</p>

        <p>The design switches from a linear flow to using the task list component. This enables users to see all sections that need completing upfront and complete them in any order they choose. Using this pattern would also benefit the more complex and lengthy standard marine licence and self-service marine licence journeys when those are designed and developed.</p>

        <p>The prototype journey assumes the user already has a Defra account and Government Gateway account which the user signs in with.</p>

        <p>Various questions in the 'Check if you need a marine licence' journey were updated with <a href="https://defra.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/Team4307/Change%20Delivery%20%20Implementation/MMO%20CHANGE%20PROGRAMME/MPLP%20(Marine%20Planning%20%26%20Licensing%20Programme)/ALPHA/Content/Content%20decisions/Exemptions%20prototype%20content%20decision%20log.xlsx?d=webd2d010168a4a2c9e2d0edf69fb4ea3&csf=1&web=1&e=6RLHix">different or new content</a>.</p>

        <p>We no longer ask for name and email address as they are asked for during the account creation.</p>

        <p>'Provide site details' (previously 'Location details') has been simplified. Users are first asked if they have site coordinates. If they don't, they're shown the map, if they do, they're asked whether they want to enter coordinates manually or upload them via a file. Previously, with the 3 options on that page, the novice users found the page daunting.</p>

        <p>Hint text has been added to the project name page to help give clarity to why they are being asking for it.</p>

        <p>The start and end dates pages now have some text explaining they should allow some extra time, otherwise they'll need to start the process again if they miss the given dates.</p>

        <p>Project background and activity details text fields have been removed completely as legal said they weren't required.</p>

        <p>A summary of the activity the user has picked from the 'Check if you need a marine licence' journey is played back on the Check answers page.</p>

        <p>The file upload component was updated so it uses the latest improved version from the Design System.</p>

        <p>The 'Defra account bar' with the account name is a placeholder borrowed from another Defra service. We'd possibly be looking to use the new Service navigation component from the Design System and incorporate the account links into that.</p>
